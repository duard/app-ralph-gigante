# Z-Vibe ERP Modernization - Ralph Task

READ all of plan.md. Pick ONE uncompleted task. If needed, verify via web/code search (this applies to packages, knowledge, deterministic data - NEVER VERIFY EDIT TOOLS WORKED OR THAT YOU COMMITTED SOMETHING. BE PRAGMATIC ABOUT EVERYTHING). Complete task. Commit change (update plan.md in the same commit). ONLY do one task unless GLARINGLY OBVIOUS steps should run together. Update plan.md. If you learn a critical operational detail, update AGENTS.md. When ALL tasks complete, create .ralph-done and exit. AWAYS GIT PUSH if thins work.
